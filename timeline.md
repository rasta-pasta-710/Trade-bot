I'd be happy to help create a timeline markdown file, but I need more information about your Trade-bot project to generate an accurate one.

Could you provide:

1. **Project overview** - What does the bot do? (trading strategy, exchanges, etc.)
2. **Current features** - What functionality exists now?
3. **Development milestones** - Key dates or versions completed?
4. **Profitability timeline** - When do you expect to reach profitability? (launch, optimization phases, etc.)
5. **Upcoming features** - What's planned next?

Alternatively, if you'd like, I can create a generic trading bot development timeline template that you can customize:

```markdown
# Trade-bot Development Timeline

## Phase 1: Foundation (Q1)
- [ ] Core trading logic
- [ ] Exchange API integration
- [ ] Backtesting framework

## Phase 2: Optimization (Q2)
- [ ] Strategy refinement
- [ ] Risk management
- [ ] Paper trading

## Phase 3: Production (Q3)
- [ ] Live deployment
- [ ] Monitoring & alerts
- [ ] Profitability validation
```

Which approach would be more helpful?
